Finally we hired a new secret agent and moved agent Huffman to do some harmless
paperwork. That's the good news. The bad news is that agent Huffman made it his
mission to train our new agent and this went exactly as expected - i.e. we cannot
decode the report received from the new agent.

Long story short, agent Huffman Junior sent us this file:

We don't really know how to decode it, nor do we care at this point. Please take
a look and decode it if you can.

GOOD LUCK!

If you decode the answer, put it in the comments under this video! If you write
a blogpost / post your solution online, please add a link in the comments too!

P.S. I'll show/explain the solution on the stream next week.
